      Clash Royale is a mobile game released by Supercell in the spring of 2016.
      The game is set in the same world of their popular game "Clash of Clans",
      and has some recurring characters from the mentioned series. While also
      adding some new ones to stand out as it's own title in the series. The
      game quickly rose to the top of the charts for most lucrative game on the
      app store, most popular game, and most popular app, Supercell saw these
      numbers, and have consistently released large updates for the game, some
      just balance changes, and some complete overhauls to how the game is
      played. This has been going on consistently for the past 6 years, and
      shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.
